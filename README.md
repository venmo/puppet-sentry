## Overview

The sentry module installs, configures, and manages the
[Sentry](http://sentry.readthedocs.org/) realtime event logging and
aggregation platform. It supports Sentry version 7.x.x on the following
platforms:

* Debian 7 (Wheezy)
* Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise)
* Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty)

## Module Description

Installation is via PyPI or Git, with support for arbitrary PyPI versions
or Git revisions. Configuration supports optional database integration
with MySQL/Postgres, caching/queueing with Redis, and a reverse SSL proxy,
though these must be deployed separately (for which a
[profile](http://www.craigdunn.org/2012/05/239/) is recommended).
Service management is done with [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/).

## Setup

### What sentry affects

* A Python virtualenv is created with Sentry and required dependencies.
* A Sentry configuration is generated based on provided class parameters.
* A SQLite database is created and its contents initialized.
* Supervisor is deployed to manage the Sentry web and worker services.

### Beginning with sentry

A basic deploy with the latest version listening on
`http://localhost:9000` can be done with

    include sentry

An admin user is also created for evaluation purposes with username
`admin` and password `password`.

To specify a PyPI version instead, run

```puppet
class { 'sentry':
  version => '7.x.x'
}
```

or for a specific Git revision (branch, tag, or commit sha1) on
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/

```puppet
class { 'sentry':
  source_location => 'git',
  git_revision    => 'master',
}
```

Note that installing from Git will also install git and nodejs packages
required for building from source.

## Usage

To allow for more widespread evaluation (say over a VPN), pass extra parameters
like the following (**IMPORTANT**: don't use these values for `password_hash`
and `secret_key`, see [Security](#security) for how to generate your own)

```puppet
class { 'sentry':
  password_hash => 'pbkdf2_sha256$20000$9tjS6wreTjar$oAdyvcOd8HCMuBpxdyvv2Cg7xz6Ee1IVz30zYUA46Wg=',
  secret_key    => 'bxXkluWCyi7vNDDALvCKOGCI2WEbohkpF9nVPnV6jWGB1grz5csT3g==',
  email         => 'sentry@example.com',
  url           => 'http://sentry.example.lan:9000',  # must not have a trailing slash
  host          => '0.0.0.0',
}
```

For a basic production-ready deploy with support for Postgres, Redis, and a
reverse SSL proxy deployed separately on the same host, pass extra parameters
like the following (**IMPORTANT**: don't use these values for `password_hash`
and `secret_key`, see [Security](#security) for how to generate your own)

```puppet
class { 'sentry':
  password_hash   => 'pbkdf2_sha256$20000$9tjS6wreTjar$oAdyvcOd8HCMuBpxdyvv2Cg7xz6Ee1IVz30zYUA46Wg=',
  secret_key      => 'bxXkluWCyi7vNDDALvCKOGCI2WEbohkpF9nVPnV6jWGB1grz5csT3g==',
  email           => 'sentry@example.com',
  url             => 'https://sentry.example.com',  # must not have a trailing slash
  database        => 'postgres',
  database_config => {
    user     => 'sentry',
    password => 'randompassword',  # this should come from an encrypted source like hiera-eyaml
  },
  proxy_enabled   => true,
  redis_enabled   => true,
}
```

For further instructions on preparing a production-ready deploy, see the
parameter list in [Reference](#reference) and the following Sentry
documentation:

* [Initializing the Configuration](http://sentry.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart/index.html#initializing-the-configuration)
* [Configure Redis](http://sentry.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart/index.html#configure-redis)
* [Setup a Reverse Proxy](http://sentry.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart/index.html#setup-a-reverse-proxy)

### Security

The values for `password_hash` and `secret_key` are the admin user's password
hash and the django secret key respectively. It's important to use your own
values for these as the defaults are insecure.

* `password_hash` can be generated by the
  [passlib](https://pythonhosted.org/passlib/install.html) python module
  (installation required) as shown at https://pythonhosted.org/passlib/lib/passlib.hash.django_std.html#django-1-4-hashes
* `secret_key` can be randomly generated with the following Python command:
  `python -c "import os; from base64 import b64encode; print(b64encode(os.urandom(40)))"`
